	<h1>Sweden a real paradise on Earth</h1>
<p>This is the caption for Layout Figure Tag</figcaption></figure>Sweden, country located on the Scandinavian Peninsula in northern Europe. The name Sweden was derived from the Svear, or Suiones, a people mentioned as early as 98 CE by the Roman author Tacitus. <em><strong>The country’s ancient name was Svithiod. Stockholm has been the permanent capital since 1523.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>	Sweden occupies the greater part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, which it shares with Norway.</strong></em> The land slopes gently from the high mountains along the Norwegian frontier eastward to the Baltic Sea. Geologically, it is one of the oldest and most stable parts of the Earth’s crust. Its surface formations and soils were altered by the receding glaciers of the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago).
</p>
<p>The northern part of Sweden which is called Uppland is populated by a minorty ethnic non-swedish tribe called Sammis, who also play a great role in <a href="culture.html">swedish culture </a>in general</p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>Lakes dot the fairly flat landscape, and thousands of islands form archipelagoes along more than 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of jagged, rocky coastline. Like all of northwestern Europe, Sweden has a generally favourable climate relative to its northerly latitude owing to moderate southwesterly winds and the warm North Atlantic Current.</p>
	<p>The most interesting part of Swedish cultural diversity is its different languages that are spoken, for example all over the countr,as they are :</p>
